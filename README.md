Contributors : Manya Kumar, Nicolas Benavides

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This parking lot simulates a parking lot using object-oriented principles in Java. It models the behaviour of vehicles entering and exiting the lot, availability depending on the rules set for parking spaces and vehicle types. The simulation enhances class design, and basic event-driven logic.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1. Practice object-oriented programming such as inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation.
2. Use Java collection to manage vehicles in real-time.
3. Implement simulation logic using condition checking.
